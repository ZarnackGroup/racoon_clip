racoon_clip - What is it?
=========================

racoon_clip processes your iCLIP and eCLIP data from raw files to single-nucleotide crosslinks in a single step. It is an automation of the iCLIP pipeline published by Busch *et al.* 2020 (`iCLIP data analysis: A complete pipeline from sequencing reads to RBP binding sites <https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ymeth.2019.11.008>`_) making the same processing now available for both iCLIP and eCLIP data in a highly reproducible manner. 

The performed steps are a quality filter (optional), demultiplexing (optional), adapter trimming, genome alignment,  deduplication (optional) and selection of single nucleotide crosslinks. For details on the performed steps please see :ref:`Detailed description of steps performed by racoon`.

Usage
=========================
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
Once installed you can run racoon with:

.. code:: bash

   racoon_clip run --cores <number_of_cores> --configfile </path/to/config/file.yaml>
