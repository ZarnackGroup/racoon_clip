# racoon-clip

racoon_clip processes your iCLIP and eCLIP data from raw files to single-nucleotide crosslinks in a single step. It is an automatition of the iCLIP pipeline pubished by Busch et al. 2020 ([iCLIP data analysis: A complete pipeline from sequencing reads to RBP binding sites](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ymeth.2019.11.008)) making the same processing now availabe for both iCLIP and eCLIP data in a highly reproducible manner. 

The performed steps are an optional quality filter, optional demultiplaexing, adapter trimming, genome alignment, optional deduplication and selection of single nucleotide crosslinks. For details on the performed steps please have a look at the [documentation](racoon-clip.readthedocs.io).
